Code + Tests (Library)
================================================================================
A database driver which uses $wpdb (can't test it, though?)

Maybe I can test the MVC classes I'll be writing?

Add RegEx support to replacer
    Add RegEx support -- Special worry about UTF data!
    Test RegEx support

Interfaces
================================================================================
WordPress plugin
    The replacement entry point should be a separate .php page, directly accessible, which is locked by a password.
    The password will be based off the site's secret.

    A main page to enter replacements and choose what to exclude from the process (whole tables or just some columns)
    A quick interface to populate that based on old and new site's URL and path on the server

    A page to show past jobs and their output SQL file, backup SQL file, log
    Can export to JSON and import from JSON

    Restore from backup page
        I need to implement the db restoration code first!

    Options page
        Auto-output to SQL
        Take automatic backups
        Log level
        Maximum number of jobs to keep

    A page and a script to show the URL and path to the current site
    Option to save the URL and path to the site in the database. We can use that to populate the quick changes UI.

CLI
    Single PHAR file, maybe use Symfony console package or similar to create the interface

Standalone
    Single file build (with stripped comments and extraneous newlines) like we do for Kickstart
