Immediate actions & pending tests:
================================================================================
Create test data, engine_parts_test.xml
    We have different possibilities for replacing data
        BORG, uppercase, will be REPLACED (plain text)
        borg, lowercase, will NOT be replaced (plain text)
        bar, whole word, will be be REPLACED (regex)
        bar, partial word (e.g. barber, barman, rebar) will NOT be replaced (regex)
    tst_partial
        Add rows with title (the ignored column) set to BORG, bar and others -- with and without replaceable data in the something column
    tst_userfiltered
        Add some bits to be replaced, it will be ignored
    nontst_table1
        Add some bits to be replaced, it will be ignored
    tst_table3
        Make serialized data with stdClass, array and a random class name
        Include both replaceable and non-replaceable data

Core\Part\Database
    Database test
    Make sure the tick() loop is not called too many times!
    Use a special prefix not used by other tests
    Use a mock Table object
    The mock creates a list of the tables it's called against and does NOT write to files
    Check that our mock object is NOT called with excluded tables' names
    Check that our mock object is NOT called with a VIEW's name
    Check that our mock object IS called X times where X is the number of the other tables

Core\Part\Table
    Database + vfs test
    Make sure the tick() loop is not called too many times!
    Prime with specific content
    Check the resulting SQL


Code + Tests (Library)
================================================================================
Add RegEx support to replacer
    Add RegEx support -- Special worry about UTF data!
    Test RegEx support

Interfaces

WordPress plugin
