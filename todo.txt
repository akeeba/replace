Tests:
================================================================================
Before we begin...
    Create a SQL file to set up the database
    Create a SQL file to create missing database tables, truncate them
    How to best run these SQL files? Bootstrap? Something else?
    Create XML(?) datasets with sample data (I'll need to pepper some serialized and replaceable data in there as well)
    Create a test case to repopulate the tables, see https://phpunit.de/manual/5.0/en/database.html

Integrate with Travis CI
    Make sure the tests (especially DB) run properly
    Link the test status in the README

Detection\WordPress
    Create two sample directories, one with the files this class is looking for and one with missing files.
    Remember to pass $configFile in the test cases. This lets me use alternative wp-config.php files to catch weird cases.

Code + Tests (Library)
================================================================================

Add RegEx support to replacer
    Add RegEx support -- Special worry about UTF data!
    Test RegEx support

Timer interface

Logger interface (use PSR?)

Engine part interface

Engine part
    Dependency: timer
    Dependency: logger

Database iterator Interface (extends engine part interface)
    Input: list of filters

Database iterator
    Dependency: DB driver
    Dependency: table iterator(s)
    Gets the available table names
    Runs the iterator(s) against each one
    !! Tests should run against simulated data

Table iterator Interface (extends engine part interface)
    Input: table name (string)
    Input: table information
    Input: column information

Table modifying iterator
    Dependency: DB driver
    Dependency: logger
    Dependency: table callback(s)
    Dependency: table DDL backup callback(s)
    Input: table name (string)
    Input: table information
    Input: column information
    Runs the table callback(s) against the table. Run the backup callbacks if the new table information differs.

Table Callback Interface
    Input: table name (string)
    Input: table information
    Input: column information
    Return: new table and column information

Collation Change table callback
    Dependency: writer interface, used to write to SQL files. No writer = no export.
    Dependency: logger
    Configuration: new collation for table, column
    Configuration: dry run
    The resulting DDL may be run (if not dry run) and/or output to a SQL file (if writer is provided)

Engine Change table callback
    Dependency: writer interface, used to write to SQL files. No writer = no export.
    Dependency: logger
    Configuration: preferred engine, default InnoDB
    Configuration: dry run
    The resulting DDL may be run (if not dry run) and/or output to a SQL file (if writer is provided)

Table DDL backup Interface
    Dependency: writer interface
    Input: table name (string)
    Input: old table information
    Input: new table information
    Input: old column information
    Input: new column information

Collation Change DDL backup callback
    The resulting DDL is written to the backup SQL file

Engine Change DDL backup callback
    The resulting DDL is written to the backup SQL file

Data processing table iterator (engine part)
    Dependency: DB driver
    Dependency: logger
    Dependency: row processing callback
    Dependency: row backup callback
    Fetches column information and table size, processes the table in chunks
    Each chunk consists of many rows
    For each row we call one or more callbacks (DO NOT pass the DB connection to the callbacks!)
    !! Tests should run against simulated data

Row Callback interface
    Input: Original Row
    Input: table name (string)
    Input: table information
    Input: column information
    Return: processed row

Row Backup Callback interface
    Input: Original Row
    Input: Modified Row
    Input: table name (string)
    Input: table information
    Input: column information
    Return: void

Plain text replace row callback
    Dependency: writer interface, used to write to SQL files. No writer = no export.
    Dependency: DB driver
    Dependency: logger
    Configuration: do it live or dry run (dry run does NOT execute SQL)

RegEx replace row callback
    extending the plain text callback, only differs in the way it handles the replacement

Row Backup callback
    Dependency: writer interface, used to write to backup SQL files
    Dependency: DB driver
    Dependency: logger

Writer interface

Writer implementation
    Dependency: logger
    Configuration: file

Logger
    PSR logger implementation?
