## Release highlights

**Something**. Something.

## PHP 5.4+ is required

Akeeba Replace requires PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 or 7.2. It will _NOT_ run on hosts running PHP 5.3 or earlier, including PHP 5.2, 5.1, 5.0 and all 4.x versions.

We strongly recommend using PHP 7.2. It's not just about the security of your site. PHP 7.2 is an average of 4x and a maximum of 8x faster than PHP 5.3. Faster PHP means lower page load times. Lower page load times mean better search engine rankings. Simply put, if you decide to stick with an old version of PHP you're shooting your feet.
